> Twitter's timeline implementation using FlightJS

Previously react-timeline (Twitter's timeline implementation using [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react)), but I think it's better to use Twitter's JS Framework: [FlightJS](https://github.com/flightjs/flight). All data are stored in LocalStorage using [Depot](https://github.com/mkuklis/depot.js)
