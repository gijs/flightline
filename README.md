> Twitter's timeline simulation using FlightJS

Previously react-timeline (Twitter's timeline simulation using [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react)), but I think it's better to use Twitter's JS Framework: [FlightJS](https://github.com/flightjs/flight). All data are stored in LocalStorage using [Depot](https://github.com/mkuklis/depot.js)

## Why

This is just for fun project for me to learn FlightJS. More like ToDo apps twitter-style.

## ToDo

- Autohide and disable tweet button on empty input
- Ability to delete tweet (for cleaning, actually)
- Display date info on tweet (date data already stored)
- Parse tweet using tweetFormatter (already in bower) before added to timeline
- Parse tweet onInput
